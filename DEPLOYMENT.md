## 🔧 Important Configuration Details

### Build Settings
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build:web",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "framework": null
}
```

### What We Fixed

1. **Infinite Loading Issue**
   - Added timeout handlers (8s for preferences, 10s for location)
   - Removed auto-fetch on HomeScreen mount
   - Added Welcome screen for initial state

2. **Location Service**
   - Graceful timeout handling
   - User-initiated location requests only
   - Clear error messages

3. **Better User Experience**
   - Welcome screen on first load
   - Manual location/search triggers
   - No stuck loading screens

## 🌐 After Deployment

### Test Your Deployment

1. **Visit your Vercel URL** (e.g., `your-app.vercel.app`)

2. **You should see:**
   - Welcome screen with two options
   - "Use My Location" button
   - "Search City" button

3. **Test functionality:**
   - Click "Use My Location" → Should request location permission
   - Click "Search City" → Should open search screen
   - Try searching for a city (e.g., "London")
   - Check if weather data loads correctly

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue: Still seeing blue loading screen**
- Clear browser cache and hard reload (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify API key in `src/config/env.js`

**Issue: Location not working**
- This is expected on first load now
- Click "Use My Location" button
- Grant permission when prompted

**Issue: Build fails**
- Check build logs in Vercel dashboard
- Verify all dependencies are installed
- Ensure Node.js version >=16

**Issue: Weather data not loading**
- Verify OpenWeather API key is valid
- Check API key has not exceeded rate limits (60 calls/minute for free tier)
- Test API key locally first
